/**
 * BambuStudio CLI profile flattener.
 *
 * Background: BambuStudio's bundled profile JSONs (Resources/profiles/BBL/...)
 * use an `inherits` chain that the GUI resolves at runtime but the CLI does
 * not. Passing a leaf profile straight to `--load-settings` / `--load-filaments`
 * yields a partial config and the slicer asserts (e.g. `nozzle_volume_type
 * not found` -> SIGSEGV / assertion in MutablePolygon.cpp / Geometry.hpp).
 * See https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/issues/9636 and #9968.
 *
 * This module:
 *   1. Indexes every BBL profile JSON by its `name` field.
 *   2. Recursively walks `inherits`, deep-merging parent into child.
 *   3. Derives `nozzle_volume_type` from `default_nozzle_volume_type[0]`
 *      (the GUI does this implicitly; the CLI doesn't).
 *   4. Merges CLI-specific machine_limits from `BBL/cli_config.json` so the
 *      printer doesn't run unsafe accelerations / jerks.
 *   5. Writes the flattened JSON to a temp file the caller passes to
 *      BambuStudio CLI.
 *
 * BBL only. Other vendors are out of scope and rejected explicitly so we
 * fail loud rather than producing dangerous gcode for hardware we don't own.
