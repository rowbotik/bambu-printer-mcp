```
1838855 feat: add delete_printer_file MCP tool
12ae6b9 fix(h2): require explicit AMS mapping; reject SuperTack on CLI slicing
```

On top of those: new `camera_snapshot` MCP tool — TCP-on-6000 JPEG frame
fetch with strict per-model routing. **`npm test` now passes 33/33**
(added 5 camera tests on top of the 5 delete tests landed in `1838855`).
Not committed yet — see "Working state" below.

### `camera_snapshot` — what shipped

- Implements the OpenBambuAPI wire format (80-byte auth packet, 16-byte
  frame header) for **A1 / A1 mini / P1S / P1P**. Verified against the
  Doridian video.md spec.
- **X1 / X1C / X1E / P2S** → fail-fast with a pointer at the RTSP URL
  (`rtsps://bblp:<token>@<host>:322/streaming/live/1`). RTSP support is
  deferred.
- **H2 / H2S / H2D** → fail-fast: wire protocol is not documented
  upstream and we refuse to guess. Same lesson as the SuperTack /
  CLI-slicing path. Track upstream `video.md` and re-enable when verified.
- Returns `{ status, format, sizeBytes, base64, savedTo? }`. Optional
  `save_path` writes the bytes to disk in addition to returning base64.
- Default 8s timeout for cold-start camera latency.

### Why this won't help Parker today

User's primary printer is H2S, which is in the undocumented bucket.
`camera_snapshot` will refuse with a clear error there. This was a
deliberate choice — shipping correctness rather than guessing at the
wire format on a printer we can't easily test against. Future work:
either reverse-engineer the H2 protocol from a packet capture or wait
for upstream docs.

### Working state

Tracked local changes since `12ae6b9`:

- `README.md` — features bullet, new `delete_printer_file` section
- `PROGRESS.md` — this section
- `src/index.ts` — tool registration + dispatch case
- `src/printers/bambu.ts` — `deleteFile()` (public) and `ftpDelete()` (private)
- `tests/behavior.test.mjs` — 5 new tests:
  - `confirm:true` required, otherwise `status: "skipped"` with no FTP
  - path traversal rejected
  - paths outside `cache/`/`timelapse/`/`logs/` rejected
  - happy path: bare names normalize to `cache/`, ftpDelete called with absolute path
  - `timelapse/` and `logs/` paths accepted as-is
- rebuilt `dist/` (`dist/index.js`, `dist/printers/bambu.js`)

Suggested commit message:

```
feat: add delete_printer_file MCP tool

- New deleteFile() in BambuImplementation: FTPS DELETE via basic-ftp
  using the same TLS-session-ticket dance as ftpUpload.
- Confirm-gated (confirm:true required) so a default invocation can't
  destroy data; returns status:"skipped" otherwise without contacting
  the printer.
- Path safety: rejects ".." segments, restricts deletes to cache/,
  timelapse/, and logs/ to prevent walking the filesystem.
- Bare filenames default to cache/<name>; relative paths to other
  allowed dirs are honored as-is.
- README features bullet + delete_printer_file tool section updated.
- 5 new unit tests cover the gating, path safety, and happy path.

Total npm test: 28/28.
```

## Current handoff (2026-04-27)

Branch: `codex/collar-charm-h2-cleanup`.

This file is the source-of-truth handoff if the active assistant thread runs
out of context. Read this section first, then continue the queue below.

### Current worktree

Tracked local changes:

- `.gitignore`
- `README.md`
- `src/index.ts`
- `src/printers/bambu.ts`
- `src/stl/stl-manipulator.ts`
- `tests/behavior.test.mjs`
- rebuilt `dist/index.js`, `dist/printers/bambu.js`, `dist/stl/stl-manipulator.js`

Ignored/local-only artifacts:

- `.claude/worktrees/` — Claude Code nested worktree cache; do not commit.
- `docs/*.gcode.3mf` — private/generated sliced print artifacts; do not commit.

### Latest verified status

- `npm test` passes: **23/23**.
- H2S/Parker read-only status works.
- A pre-sliced one-color H2S SuperTack print completed on Parker.
- The successful physical print path used `print_3mf` with:
  - `bambu_model: "h2s"`
  - `bed_type: "supertack_plate"`
  - explicit `ams_slots: [0]`
  - `use_ams: true`
- Sends with `use_ams: false` were accepted by the MCP layer but did not
  visibly start the job.

### Decisions from the live H2S test

- SuperTack is valid for **pre-sliced** print jobs.
- BambuStudio CLI SuperTack slicing is **not verified**. Attempts to encode
  SuperTack in flattened CLI profiles produced G-code that fell back to Cool
  Plate. The MCP now fails fast for `supertack_plate` on CLI slicing and
  auto-slicing paths.
- On H2/H2D, do **not** trust embedded `slicerConfig.ams_mapping` parsed from
  the 3MF. It can be stale project metadata.
- H2 pre-sliced jobs with declared filaments must provide one of:
  - explicit `ams_slots`
  - raw project-level `ams_mapping`
  - `auto_match_ams: true`
- If none is provided, the server now fails before upload/send.
- `ams_slots` is still the preferred API: one physical tray per used filament
  in `plate_N.json.filament_ids` order. The printer layer expands that into
  project-level `ams_mapping` and `ams_mapping2`.

Recovered Claude evidence to preserve:

```text
G-code header project filaments:
; filament_ids    = GFG02;GFG01;GFL00;GFL03
; filament_colour = #FFFFFF;#FF911A80;#DCF478;#DCF478
; filament_type   = PETG;PETG;PLA;PLA

plate_1.json.filament_ids = [1]
physical tray = AMS 0 slot 1

Working H2 mapping:
ams_mapping:  [-1, 1, -1, -1]
ams_mapping2: [{255,255}, {0,1}, {255,255}, {255,255}]
```

Rule: `ams_mapping` length must match the project-level filament declaration
from the G-code header, and the populated position must match the
project-level filament index from `plate_N.json.filament_ids`.

### Tests added in current work

- H2 `print_3mf` rejects pre-sliced filament jobs without explicit mapping
  before FTP/network.
- H2 `ams_slots` expands into project-level `ams_mapping` and `ams_mapping2`;
  regression covers the recovered case where `plate_1.json.filament_ids = [1]`
  and `ams_slots = [1]` expands to `[-1, 1, -1, -1]`.

### CC side work

Claude Code created a nested worktree at:

```text
.claude/worktrees/cool-saha-810d33
```

It contains two commits on top of `08f6afe`:

- `ff42958 chore: bump to 1.1.0 and add CHANGELOG`
- `abcb47a docs: update PROGRESS for 1.1.0 publish attempt and next queue`

Do not blindly cherry-pick yet. Current H2/SuperTack behavior and regression
tests should land first. Then selectively port `CHANGELOG.md` / version bump if
we want to prepare `1.1.0`.

### Next queue

1. Review the current diff for scope.
2. Commit the H2/SuperTack/mapping fixes and tests once satisfied.
3. After that, decide whether to port CC's `CHANGELOG.md` and `1.1.0` version
   bump from `.claude/worktrees/cool-saha-810d33`.
4. Optional follow-up: improve `auto_match_ams` live behavior for Parker once
   we have a loaded AMS inventory snapshot that reports trays reliably.
5. Optional future features from prior queue: camera snapshot, printer-file
   delete, live validation for skip objects/light/fan/utility controls.

### Verification commands

```bash
cd /Users/alexbuchan/Sync/bambu-printer-mcp
npm test
git status --short --branch
```

Expected now: `npm test` passes 23/23. Status should show only the tracked
worktree changes listed above; `.claude/worktrees/` and private `.gcode.3mf`
files should be ignored.

Post-commit verification rerun on 2026-04-26:

- `npm test` passed (`npm run build` + 9/9 flattener tests).
- `scripts/test-cli-slice.mjs` passed for `h2s`, `h2d`, `x1c`, and `p1s`.
- Direct MCP stdio `slice_stl` call with `BAMBU_CLI_FLATTEN=true` returned
  `temp/sample_cube_sliced.3mf`; verified it contains
  `Metadata/plate_1.gcode` (110,970 bytes), `project_settings.config`, and
  `slice_info.config`.

Follow-up verification:

- `npm test` now runs both root and nested test files and passed 18/18.
- Added parser coverage proving H2D `plate_1.json.filament_ids` maps to
  `slice_info.config` `tray_info_idx` (`GFG02` in the fixture).

## What's done

### 1. Profile flattener — `src/slicer/profile-flatten.ts`

Walks BBL `inherits` chain, deep-merges parent → child, and emits CLI-ready
temp configs that work around upstream BambuStudio CLI bugs
([#9636](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/issues/9636),
[#9968](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/issues/9968)).

Key behaviors:

- Indexes every `*.json` in `<profilesRoot>/BBL/{machine,process,filament}` by
  `name` field.
- Walks `inherits` recursively (with cycle + missing-parent detection).
- Sets `from: "User"`, `inherits: <leaf machine name>` so the CLI's
  `system_name` resolution lands on a value present in the leaves'
  `compatible_printers` lists. (Source: `BambuStudio.cpp` ~line 2222.)
- Derives `nozzle_volume_type` (array, one entry per nozzle) from
  `default_nozzle_volume_type[]`. Hardware invariant: both nozzles always
  match (validator throws on mismatched array).
- Applies per-printer overlay from `BBL/cli_config.json` (CLI safety
  machine_limits — accel/jerk/speed envelopes).
- Sets `printer_settings_id` / `print_settings_id` /
  `filament_settings_id` from the leaf names so the GUI's project shape is
  mirrored.
- Auto-extends `compatible_printers` to include the chosen machine when the
  user picked a non-default printer/process combo (mirrors GUI save behavior).
- BBL only — explicit error for other vendors.

Public API: `flattenForCli(opts)` and `detectProfilesRoot(slicerPath?)`.

### 2. MCP wire-up — `src/stl/stl-manipulator.ts`

New private method `maybeFlattenBundle()` post-processes the existing
`resolveBambuLikeSettingsBundle()` output. Gated by env var
`BAMBU_CLI_FLATTEN=true`. Default off; backward-compatible.

When enabled:

1. Reads each leaf JSON's `name` field from the bundle paths.
2. If all three (machine, process, filament) resolve to BBL leaves, calls
   `flattenForCli` and replaces the bundle paths with flattened temp paths.
3. On any failure, logs and falls back to the unflattened bundle.

Only affects the `bambustudio` slicer branch. Other slicers untouched.

### 3. Pause / resume MQTT tools

- `src/printers/bambu.ts`: `pauseJob()` and `resumeJob()` (mirror
  `cancelJob`'s `UpdateStateCommand` pattern with `state: "pause"` / `"resume"`).
- `src/index.ts`: `pause_print` and `resume_print` tools registered alongside
  `cancel_print`. Same arg shape (host/serial/token, all optional with env
  fallback).

### 4. Test fixtures — `tests/fixtures/h2d_gui_sliced/`

Saved from your freshly-sliced H2D `.gcode.3mf` so we have GUI ground truth
for any future flattener changes. Three files:

- `project_settings.config` (84 KB, 558 keys — the GUI's flattened output)
- `plate_1.json`
- `slice_info.config`

The original 3MF lives at `docs/mk2 collarID.gcode.3mf.3mf.gcode.3mf` — not
needed for tests (we extracted what we need), can stay un-tracked.

### 5. Smoke test — `scripts/test-cli-slice.mjs`

Standalone runner. Usage:

```bash
node scripts/test-cli-slice.mjs --model h2s|h2d|x1c|p1s [--filament NAME] [--keep-temp]
```

Asserts:

- CLI exits 0.
- Output 3MF exists.
- `Metadata/plate_<n>.gcode` is present and >1 KB.

### 6. Documentation

- `docs/SLICING.md`: rewrote into Path A (GUI, recommended) + Path B (CLI
  flatten, opt-in). Documents the mechanics of Path B and links upstream
  issues.
- `README.md`:
  - Features: pause/resume bullet; auto-slice bullet rewritten to point at
    `BAMBU_CLI_FLATTEN`.
  - Tools: added `pause_print` and `resume_print` sections after
    `cancel_print`.
  - Env var reference: added `BAMBU_CLI_FLATTEN` and `BAMBU_PROFILES_ROOT`.

feat: BambuStudio CLI auto-flatten + pause/resume tools

- New src/slicer/profile-flatten.ts: walks BBL inherits chain, derives
  nozzle_volume_type, applies cli_config overlay, sets
  from/inherits/settings_id so the CLI accepts flattened profiles.
  Workaround for upstream BambuStudio issues #9636 / #9968.
- Verified end-to-end on H2S, H2D, X1C, P1S with stock BBL profiles.
- Wired into stl-manipulator behind BAMBU_CLI_FLATTEN=true (default off).
- New pause_print / resume_print MQTT tools alongside cancel_print.
- Docs: SLICING.md split into Path A (GUI) and Path B (CLI flatten),
  README features + tool docs + env var reference updated.
- Test fixtures from a real H2D GUI slice for ground-truth comparison.
- 9 unit tests for the flattener (chain resolution, cycle detection,
  nozzle_volume_type shape, hardware invariant, end-to-end against the
  installed BBL tree).
```

## Queue (not yet started)

### High priority

- **End-to-end test through the actual MCP tool surface.** `slice_stl` via
  MCP stdio is verified with `BAMBU_CLI_FLATTEN=true`; still need a live
  `print_3mf` run against H2S/H2D when it is safe to start a physical print.
- **Post upstream comment on bambulab/BambuStudio#9636.** ✅ Posted:
  https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/issues/9636#issuecomment-4323987647.
  Dossier is saved at `docs/BAMBUSTUDIO-CLI-UPSTREAM-COMMENT.md`. Includes:
  - Root-cause walkthrough with line numbers from `BambuStudio.cpp`.
  - Three independent breakages reproduced and resolved.
  - Userland workaround (link to this PR/repo).
  - Offer to upstream a `--auto-flatten` flag.

### Bambuddy-inspired features (per user prioritization)

- **MUST HAVE:** ✅ pause / resume — done.
- **VERY MUCH WANT:** ✅ AMS auto-match by RFID — implemented as
  `resolve_3mf_ams_slots` dry run plus opt-in `print_3mf auto_match_ams`.
  Still needs live H2S/H2D print validation before calling it production-safe.
- **Future versions:** ✅ AMS RFID re-read tool and airduct control are
  implemented as MCP command surfaces. AMS dryer start/stop remains future work.
  RFID re-read can move AMS filament and needs live validation when physical
  testing is allowed.
- **HMS error resource:** ✅ `printer://{host}/hms` is implemented as a
  read-only diagnostics summary over the existing status path.
- **Light/fan control:** ✅ `set_light` and `set_fan_speed` are implemented
  through the existing `bambu-node` MQTT commands. They still need live-device
  validation.
- **Bambuddy-inspired utility controls:** ✅ `set_print_speed`,
  `set_airduct_mode`, `clear_hms_errors`, and `reread_ams_rfid` are implemented
  with schema coverage. They still need live-device validation.
- **Skip objects:** ✅ `list_3mf_plate_objects` and `skip_objects` are
  implemented. They still need live-print validation.

## How to verify

```bash
cd ~/Sync/bambu-printer-mcp

# Build + unit tests
npx tsc
node --test tests/slicer/profile-flatten.test.mjs

# Smoke test all four printers
for m in h2s h2d x1c p1s; do
  printf "%-5s " $m
  node scripts/test-cli-slice.mjs --model $m | grep -E "(PASS|OK:|FAIL)"
done
```

Expected: 9/9 unit tests pass, all four smoke tests print "OK: ... bytes of
gcode" and "PASS".
